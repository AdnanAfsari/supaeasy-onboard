2. Brief description of what the function does
3. Screenshots or video walkthrough showing the function working
4. Your development store domain (*.myshopify.com)

## 🎯 Evaluation Criteria

- **Documentation** (25%) - Clear explanation and visual proof
- **Code Quality** (20%) - Clean, efficient implementation
- **Creativity** (15%) - Going beyond basic requirements when appropriate

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Not everything is possible!** Some features mentioned in the requirements may not be available in SupaEasy or may have limitations. This is intentional to test your problem-solving skills. When you encounter limitations:

- **Document what's not possible** and explain why
- **Find alternative solutions** that achieve similar results
- **Show your thinking process** and how you adapted
- **Demonstrate understanding** of the business requirements even when technical limitations exist

This shows real-world problem-solving skills that are valuable in customer success roles!

## ⏰ Timeline

You have **7 days** to complete all 15 functions and submit your solution.

## 🏆 Next Steps

5. Submit your solution following the guidelines in [SUBMISSION.md](./SUBMISSION.md)
