# Product Compatibility Validation Function

## Function Name
**Product Compatibility Validation**

## Objective
Implement product compatibility validation to prevent customers from purchasing incompatible products together, showing an error message at checkout without blocking the cart experience.

## Business Requirements

### Primary Functionality
- Validate product compatibility based on product tags
- Show error message at checkout for incompatible products
- Allow products to be added to cart normally
- Prevent checkout completion until compatibility issues are resolved

### Product Compatibility Configuration
- **Incompatible tags:** "electronics" + "water-resistant" products cannot be combined
- **Error message:** "These products are not compatible. Please remove one to continue."
- **Validation trigger:** When 2+ products with conflicting tags are in cart
- **Geographic scope:** All regions
- **Display:** Clear error message at checkout only

### Business Rules
- **Tag-based validation:** Products with conflicting tags cannot be purchased together
- **Checkout validation:** Error shown only at checkout, not in cart
- **Non-blocking cart:** Customers can add products to cart normally
- **Clear messaging:** Specific error message explaining the incompatibility
- **Resolution required:** Must remove incompatible products to proceed

### Customer Experience
- Is still possible to add both product categories in cart
- Blocked checkout with clear explanation

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Compatible products:** Electronics + accessories → Checkout allowed
2. **Incompatible products:** Electronics + water-resistant → Error message at checkout
3. **Single product:** Only electronics → Checkout allowed
4. **Multiple compatible:** 3 electronics products → Checkout allowed
5. **Mixed cart:** Electronics + clothing + water-resistant → Error message at checkout
6. **Resolution:** Remove water-resistant product → Checkout allowed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Product compatibility validation works based on tags
- [ ] Error message shown at checkout for incompatible products
- [ ] Cart experience remains smooth (no blocking)
- [ ] Clear error message explaining incompatibility
- [ ] Function works across all product categories
- [ ] Checkout blocked until incompatibility resolved

## Documentation Requirements (Optional)
- Screenshot of SupaEasy configuration
- Screenshots of cart with incompatible products (no error)
- Screenshot of checkout error message for incompatible products
- Screenshot of successful checkout after removing incompatible products

## Implementation Hints
- Use **product tags** to identify incompatible product combinations
- Consider using **collections** to group products with similar compatibility requirements
- Test with **checkout validation** to ensure error messages appear at the right time
- Use **buyer journey** to allow products to be added but show errors at checkout
